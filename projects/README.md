## [Advice from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7srdqb/udemy_recommendations/)
* The front end part of Colt Steel's Web Developer Boot camp .
* Brad Schiff's Git a web developer job: mastering the modern work flow
* Brad Traversy's Modern Javascript from the beginning (this one lines up very well with the order of Javascript projects from FreeCodeCamp and TheOdinProject).
* Colt Steel's Advanced Web Developer Boot camp (the only reason to take this course is because there are very few other courses for d3 if you're pursuing the data visualization cert from FCC, otherwise there are better resources for learning every other topic covered in this course and it's the most skipple and least recommended of everything here. It does cover flexbox, which you should learn, but there are better resources for learning it like Wes Bos' What the Flexbox !? - which happens to be free) .
* Andrew Mead's The Complete React web developers course, this is the best/easiest React course I've found, I really believe that this guy is a better instructor than Colt .
* If you want to be a full stack developer with Node.js as your back end language (FCC's back end projects are in Node, TOP's back end projects are in Ruby, I chose Node so I can only recommend courses that cover Node ).
* Andrew Mead's The Complete Node developers course, I really like his teaching style and it's great that he teaches testing .
* Stephan Grider's Mongo course, I also really like this guy's teaching style and this course was fantastic .
* Stephan Grider's Node with React: fullstack development course , this one ties everything together and does a great job of explaining how the front and back end's relate and differ .

* Altogether this is over 160 hours of instruction, but you come out of it knowing how to create, test and deploy React, Mongo and Node and with a decent portfolio and a little brushing up on algorithms you'd be ready to start seeking a junior fullstack/javascript developer job for $70 of course materials vs ~$10,000 for a boot camp or ~$80,000+ for a degree .

* here's a path for developing projects outside of FCC/TOP

* check out some web designs from www.dribbble.com

* your first goal is to code the design from full size landing page from there . that's probably a little ways off, but it's the direction you should be headed in.

* Eventually you want to be able to code one of those designs and have it be responsive and functional . (and when I say one, I actually mean ~4 and when you learn React you might wanna go back and redo those pages using JSX).

* If you go for full stack the next goal is to code one of those designs and have it be responsive and functional with a back end . (It's ok to add a backend to something you've already coded)

* You can can get beautiful free images from pexels.com to use in place of the images used in dribbble designs and free hosting from github pages and Heroku .

* Udemy has a weird pricing model, but I've always been successful with google searches for "$10 Udemy coupon" .
