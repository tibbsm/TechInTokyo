## [Advice from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7srdqb/udemy_recommendations/)
* Wes Bos' What the Flexbox!? (free)
* Andrew Mead's The Complete React web developers course, this is the best/easiest React course I've found, I really believe that this guy is a better instructor than Colt .
* If you want to be a full stack developer with Node.js as your back end language (FCC's back end projects are in Node, TOP's back end projects are in Ruby, I chose Node so I can only recommend courses that cover Node ).
* Andrew Mead's The Complete Node developers course, I really like his teaching style and it's great that he teaches testing .
* Stephan Grider's Mongo course, I also really like this guy's teaching style and this course was fantastic .
* ~~Stephan Grider's Node with React: fullstack development course , this one ties everything together and does a great job of explaining how the front and back end's relate and differ .~~


* check out some web designs from www.dribbble.com
* full size landing page -> work your way to the full page that is reponsice and functional (with backend)
* implement with React and JSX
* Free images from pexels.com and free hosting from github pages and Heroku.
