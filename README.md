## <a name="remote">Remote Work</a>
* [Remote Habits](http://remotehabits.com/)
* [Companies that allow remote work in Japan](https://github.com/uiureo/remote-in-japan/blob/master/README.en.md)
* [WeWorkRemotely](https://weworkremotely.com/) - more remote jobs
---
## <a name="interview">Interviewing</a>
* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) 


* Interview Notes
  * Do all of CTCI first. It can be knocked out within a week or two if you go at it hard. Then hit up LC and start on easy's. Give yourself 45-60 minutes and if you can't solve it, look at the answer and go to another one. Once you're comfortable with easy's go up to medium. Try to solve two a day.
  * Focus on trees, linked lists, dynamic programming, arrays, and hash table questions
  * Also, there's a few algos you should definitely know like the palm of your hand. BFS, DFS, and the different kinds of level order traversals for trees come up over and over, for example.
  * Backtracking and dynamic programming are extremely common
  * Bit manipulation doesn't come up unless you're going for low level jobs, but when they do the answer probably involves XOR'ing

## <a name="notes">Notes</a>
* Remote work options and pathways
* What do you actually want to do? May not be able to be picky right now, but can start aiming for a path.
* Comparisons to the States
* https://github.com/btamada/jp-software-companies
* Learn react, js, python, java
* [Tokyo Neighborhoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Neighborhoods_of_Tokyo)
* Start looking for WA/CA jobs 
* [Application Email Example](https://www.tokyodev.com/2011/08/19/finding-a-job-as-a-ruby-developer-in-japan/)
* Be ab active part of the community
* Literally copy stuff and then tweak it
* [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=learn)
* Python "For image processing check out Pillow. For web scraping check out BeautifulSoup. For machine learning and scientific computing, check out scipy and matplotlib, or just get Anaconda."
* An app that allows not for productivity, but filters out distractions. Potentially a one task application/device. Purposefully set up new ritual/routines/habits with this thing. (Mono Tsu) Promotes a digital to analog to digital flow. Emphsizes making things. Working iteratively. Open to serendipity. Emphasizes artisnal processes. Community. 
* A place for guilt-free relaxation. One-purpose room. Leaving it all there. Places to work are simple and minimal.
