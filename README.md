## <a name="remote">Remote Work</a>
* [Remote Habits](http://remotehabits.com/)
* [Companies that allow remote work in Japan](https://github.com/uiureo/remote-in-japan/blob/master/README.en.md)
* [WeWorkRemotely](https://weworkremotely.com/) - more remote jobs

## <a name="interview">Interviewing</a>
* Do all of CTCI first. It can be knocked out within a week or two if you go at it hard. Then hit up LC and start on easy's. Give yourself 45-60 minutes and if you can't solve it, look at the answer and go to another one. Once you're comfortable with easy's go up to medium. Try to solve two a day.
* Focus on trees, linked lists, dynamic programming, arrays, and hash table questions
* Also, there's a few algos you should definitely know like the palm of your hand. BFS, DFS, and the different kinds of level order traversals for trees come up over and over, for example.
* Backtracking and dynamic programming are extremely common
* Bit manipulation doesn't come up unless you're going for low level jobs, but when they do the answer probably involves XOR'ing

## <a name="notes">Notes</a>
